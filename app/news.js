            text: "It is one of the most famous, and feared, yacht races in the world and offers its competitors the perfect cold-turkey cure for Christmas blues.\
        The Sydney-Hobart is the annual 628-nautical mile dash down the New South Wales coast to Tasmania beginning on Boxing Day, December 26.\
        Alongside events such as the Melbourne Cup on Australia's sporting landscape, the race pits amateurs and professionals together in yachts ranging in length from 30ft to 100ft.\
            Early forecasts for this year's 72nd edition suggest strong breezes could propel the 90-strong fleet across the Bass Strait, around Tasman Island and up the Derwent River in record time.\
        Wild Oats XI, which won overall on debut in 2005 and again in 2012, set the fastest time of one day 18 hrs 3min 12sec in 2012.\
        But the eight-time line honors winner, which was owned by the late wine magnate Bob Oatley, is looking to make amends for an early retirement last year because of a storm-damaged mainsail on the first night.\

            text: "MANILA, Philippines –  A tropical storm nearing the Philippines on Friday may strengthen into a typhoon, bringing moderate to heavy rains and blustery weather on Christmas Day, the biggest holiday in the predominantly Roman Catholic nation.\
        Tropical Storm Nock-Ten was 790 kilometers (490 miles) east of Guiuan town in the eastern part of the country as of Friday morning, packing winds of up to 105 kilometers per hour (65 miles per hour) and gusts of up to 130 kph (80 mph), forecasters said.\
    Landrico Dalida Jr., a deputy administrator of the government weather bureau, said Nock-Ten may intensify into a typhoon, with winds of at least 120 kph (75 mph), before it makes landfall late Sunday in the eastern part of the country.\
\"Our Christmas will be rainy, with strong winds,\" Dalida said. \"So while we celebrate, let us also prepare.\"\
Officials warned of possible landslides and flooding along the storm's path, and storm surges in coastal areas that makes sea travel risky. Stormy weather can be expected starting Saturday evening, they said.\
Nock-Ten is forecast to move northwest over northern provinces. It is expected to be over the country's capital on Monday and to exit the Philippines by Wednesday.",

        One charge used against von Boeselager concerned a program that the order's Malteser International aid group had participated in several years ago with other aid groups to help sex slaves in Myanmar, including giving them condoms to protect them from HIV infection.\
